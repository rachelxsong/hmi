We grew up going to Hebrew school 3 times/week, and Synagogue every week.  Our home was Kosher for a good chunk of my life until Jr. High, and my older brothers attended Jewish Day School (myself and my younger sister went to public elementary school).  It is very important to me that if we do have children, they are raised Jewish.  However, to me that means more culturally Jewish and Jewish in community involvement.  The religious aspect of Judaism does not appeal to either myself or my spouse.  My family still has Shabbat every week, and we intend to continue that throughout our lives whether or not we have children.  It is important to me to continue our traditions and the messages that Judaism is about, but the religion/God aspect of it does not necessarily fit our lifestyle or existential beliefs.

We do discuss this a lot, and have not really committed one way or another.  Adoption later on is something we have explored as well.

Most of my friends come from typical fully Jewish families, and are married to other Jews.  It is almost like living in a different world sometimes.  Still love my friends/family that fits into this, but it can be alienating.  When you don't feel accepted or included, it is hard to stay excited or interested in being Jewish.  It is definitely a turn off for my spouse - it was almost like I talked up this religion, and he went into it thinking it would be awesome.

My spouse always participates in Jewish things with me, and he likes the traditions a lot.  He seems to get excited to spend Jewish holidays with my family, and bake/cook Jewish foods.  He is always interested in learning about the religion and Israel.  However, it can be difficult to make him feel welcomed because as we all know, Jews can be a little cliquey with one another.  We celebrate and practice far more Jewish things than anything else (really all we ""celebrate"" is Christmas, and that really just buying presents and hanging out with his family for the weekend in a non-religious way).

I thought the group travel dynamics of my cohort were great, and that was due in large part to the leaders. 

I was surprised by this, but I found it so much easier to connect with couples closer to my age. 

I still think a lot about the trip. I think about what we did and did not (or couldn't) see with respect to Israel/Palestine. I think a lot about the experiences where we had an opportunity to sit down and hear from a political journalist, a Haredi woman, Israeli Arabs, a Kabbalist, and Mr. Infeld -- I loved those experiences. I think about how the standard narration during the tour of Yad Vashem seemed to be constructed as though I might not believe that the Holocaust happened.

He could have easily been a participant on our trip and that made him approachable and relatable.
I would be remiss not to mention that Jeff Eisner and our Israeli educator from Da'at, Lior Hochberg, were also major contributors to our HMI experience. Again, both Jeff and Lior were relatable -- and Jeff is himself an HMI alum.
Now that I write this I realize why this all mattered so much to me -- it is because the leadership on our trip became our friends as much as all of the other couples did, and I don't think Corey and I would be the only ones to say so.

While Israel (the land) is so central to the Jewish faith, I feel strongly that so much of Jewish religious practice and development, especially liberal Judaism, developed and was refined in the Diaspora - and that an obsession with Israel discredits the notion that Judaism can be practiced in a loving and emphatic way outside of the land of Israel, though I understand the history and importance of the land. 

The country/state, however, is even more complicated. As it has been said, Israel can be a Jewish state, or it can be a democracy, but it cannot be both. And even as a Jew, I don't much care for religious-state, even if they are not traditional theocracies. I don't know if that makes me anit-Zionist, but it does put me at odds with much of the Jewish community. Thus, if Israel is to be a democracy, it is worthy of much criticism, not unlike other Western states that fail to live up to their promise, or my worldview (after all, politics is fundamentally personal). It's a marvelous and incredible country, not unlike Italy or Great Britain, with a rich history, culture, and purpose. And modern Israel (the state) was created by the Diaspora - or at least a the antisemitism that is often so rampant in it - so I love the notion that it is a homeland for Jews - but I don't love the idea of it as a Jewish State run, either de facto or de jure, under Jewish law.

We feel that we were mislead with information about the program all together.  The website shares minimal information and then when you attend the interview it is made clear that they are more focused on looking for EXTREMELY diverse couples not just interested in Judaism.  It wasn't inclusive or welcoming.  With everything shared we felt more and more out of place.  As each additional couple entered the waiting room, they were more diverse.  We kept wondering why all of this wasn't more available on the website as we researched prior to the interview.  The interview was uncomfortably invasive and the interviewers will do anything to get the most personal of details out of you.  
We thought the program was mostly for interfaith couples and we were wrong about that too.  We applied looking for support from Honeymoon Israel's community and we have yet to receive any.  Our original interest for the program peaked as we saw this as an opportunity to join a Jewish community that was more our speed over a synagogue.  We wanted to meet other couples that are in the same stages of life as us so we can support each other.  We were seeking out Jewish organizations to attend, around our area, to begin learning as a couple before having our own children. By the end of the process we felt we were too average and for that we were not accepted. 
For future applicants, it would help if the expectations were made more clear.  What is the program looking for? What is the purpose of each part of the application process?  Who should apply vs who shouldn't?

That being said, I am not Jewish and I am pretty ambivalent about converting because I'm not religious and don't think I even believe in God (hence it seems weird to convert to any religion).  So a major concern for me is how I would be accepted if my children were brought up going to a synagogue and participating in Jewish life; I wouldn't want to feel like an outsider or like I wasn't really part of it. So I want to figure out how I can educate myself and participate short of conversion.

Human rights issues are really important to me, and I find it hard to reconcile some of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians, but I also realize that ""Israel"" is not one entity; it is made up of diverse people with very different points of view, and I know there are plenty of Israeli Jews who also do not support the settlements and do not support all of the policies of their government (just as I don't support all of my government's policies).",3,2,3,3,5,1,NA,NA,3,3,4,4,5,NA,4,5,3,3,4,2,NA,4,2,"No, but we are currently trying to have children",NA,2,4,5,2,"I'm not religious so it's not really true to say that we ""honor both partners' faith traditions.""

I REALLY appreciate that HMI funds events and participation in local programs for alumni (and I also think a fundraising ask could be incorporated when these subsidies are provided).",4,4,1,3,4,"",1,4,4,2,2,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,2,NA,4,4,3,4,3,5,NA,4,5,"No, but we are expecting","Jewish",2,5,3,5,"","",4,4,3,4,5,4,3,3,NA,3,3,2,2,1,2,1,3,1,2,3,3,3,3,2,5,4,3,3,"",1,4,5,NA,3,4,4,"As a couple, we have been struggling with fertility.

In the last few years, we have seen a rise in anti-Semitism worldwide and in the United States, but a coupling of white nationalism and nativism with an ironclad support for the existence and expansion of a Jewish state.  The forces that have historically (and currently) constrained and belittled Jewish values seem to value Israel, and in particular the actions of its current government.  I still feel deeply that engagement with my Judaism necessitates an engagement with the reality of the state of Israel, and my HMI experience has only strengthened that conviction.  But I worry about what Judaism can mean when anti-fascism and opposition to white nationalism can be construed as anti-Semitic, rather than the fullest expression of Jewish values.  Meeting with the bookstore owner in occupied east Jerusalem still resonates with me more fully than any other experience on the trip, and I know (and really have always known) that a Judaism that does not value the rights and needs of Palestinians equally with Israelis is not a religion or a value system worth its history or worth preservation.  I am a proud Jew and I always will be, but after Netanyahu's last victory, I find myself asking if I can be both a Jew and a Zionist.  My experience in Israel showed me a modern nation of real people, but also mostly the top half of a segregated society.  I am still processing what this means, but right now when I consider the Jewish future, I feel consumed by fear.  Israel showed me so much but not the hope of two thousand years, and the question of whether we as a people are ordinary among the nations now leaves that as a best-case scenario.  But still I hope.

Our trip to Yad Vashem. Hands down the most powerful and emotionally draining day of my life. And even though it was that draining, I wouldn't have changed anything about it. Our Tour educator Hillary was so amazing and the way she ended that tour out on the back walkway over looking the city still gives me goosebumps. We had started making some great connections by then and between my husband and these newfound friends there was so much love for us all to grasp on to. That night my husband and I had dinner with 3 other couples (don't spill our secret but we called ourselves the Core 4 haha) at the old train station and that dinner was so special to all of us. It was the perfect ending to a powerful day where we all made a bond that I honestly think will last a life time.

Judaism is foreign to my husband and Catholicism so very familiar.  That is why this trip was so very important to us - for him to experience Israel as I had experienced Israel on Birthright.  For him to mingle with couples striving through the same issue of raising an interfaith family.  The acceptance my husband has found from not only with my family but from the Jewish community as a whole (shout out HMI!) has made him SO much more comfortable with the idea of helping to lead a Jewish home.  This year, on our way home from Seder at my parents' house, my husband organically said to me - next year, we'll host and I'll lead.  I cannot express in words what this meant to me.

Do I think Catholicism will always have a place in our home?  Yes, I do.  We'll travel to my husband's parents' house for Christmas, for Easter.  We'll attend Mass as a family.

I, like I think many Jews, would like to see all of these things in my life, but it is very hard to get the courage to walk into a synagogue where I don't know anyone. So I am committed to seeing these things happen, but in reality I am not acting on that desire. I wish your survey went into this, because I believe one of the benefits of Honeymoon Israel is to lower those transaction costs and make participating easier. It is not about increasing our commitment, but about helping us fulfill the commitment. 

I have a feeling that Honeymoon Israel may be selecting the wrong people for the trip. Because they seem to be seeking people who are not committed, and then hoping they will become more committed by participating.

As a result, I became disillusioned with and skeptical of organized religion on a whole. I also felt conflicted as to how I intended to raise a family in the future ? raising children  to be Christian felt inauthentic to me but it also did not feel quite right to raise a family without religion altogether. 

I started the Judaism 101 course at The Temple as a way to learn more about Jeremy?s religion and also as an introduction to see if I wanted to raise our future children in the Jewish religion. I did not go into the course with any intention or plans to convert. However, during the course, I was really drawn to the religion and the community ? what especially stuck with me was the focus on social justice, the philosophy of the reform community that encourages the evolution of beliefs and practices over time, the concept of charity or tzedakah, and the focus on the study of the religion. 

The introduction to Judaism also reminded me of what I did like about organized religion and what I did appreciate about my upbringing. It made me realize what I was missing. I do appreciate that I was raised in a religious household and see that it has been valuable to me.

We knew we weren't guaranteed a spot or anything like that, but when we got the phone call, it was disappointing to be told that a big part of why we weren't selected was because other couples were about to exit the timeframe they'd be eligible for Honeymoon Israel, so they were prioritized. Respectfully, I'm now 36 and my wife is 34. We're trying to have a kid now, and unless there's a health reason that prohibits us from doing that, Honeymoon Israel isn't going to be an option for us in the future because we'll be raising a child. We're a couple that's begun donating to Jewish Federation of Los Angeles in what we consider a meaningful way over the last year, and really thought Honeymoon Israel would be a great way to help us as a newly married couple get closer to the Jewish community. Unfortunately by rejecting us when it was probably our only realistic opportunity to go on a trip like this, at least on my side of my marriage, I came away feeling a bit rejected, and fairly disconnected with any kind of organized Judaism.
